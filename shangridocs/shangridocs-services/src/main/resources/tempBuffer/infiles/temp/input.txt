ANNUAL CLINICAL UPDATES IN HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES:
A CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION SERIES

Mantle cell lymphoma: 2013 Update on diagnosis,
risk-stratification, and clinical management

Julie M. Vose*

Disease Overview: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by involvement
of the lymph nodes, spleen, blood, and bone marrow with a short remission duration to standard therapies
and a median overall survival of 4–5 years.
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is based on lymph node, bone marrow, or tissue morphology of centrocytic lympho-
cytes, small cell type, or blastoid variant cells. A chromosomal translocation t(11:14) is the molecular hall-
mark of MCL, resulting in the overexpression of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 is detected by immunohistochemistry
in 98% of cases. The absence of SOX-11 or a low Ki-67 may correlate with a more indolent form of MCL.
The differential diagnosis of MCL includes small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and fol-
licular lymphoma.
Risk Stratification: The Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) is the prognostic
model most often used and incorporates ECOG performance status, age, leukocyte count, and lactic dehy-
drogenase. A modification of the MIPI also adds the Ki-67 proliferative index if available. The median over-
all survival (OS) for the low risk group was not reached (5-year OS of 60%). The median OS for the
intermediate risk group was 51 months and 29 months for the high risk group.
Risk-Adapted Therapy: For selected indolent, low MIPI MCL patients, initial observation may be appropriate
therapy. For younger patients with intermediate or high risk MIPI MCL, aggressive therapy with a cytarabine
containing regimen6 autologous stem cell transplantation should be considered. For older MCL patients
with intermediate or high risk MIPI, combination chemotherapy with R-CHOP, R-Bendamustine, or a clinical
trial should be considered. At the time of relapse, agents directed at activated pathways in MCL cells such
as bortezomib (NFkB inhibitor) or lenalidamide (anti-angiogenesis) are approved agents. Clinical trials with
Ibruitinib (Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor) or Idelalisib (PI3K inhibitor) have demonstrated excellent clin-
ical activity in MCL patients. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation can also be considered in
young patients. Am. J. Hematol. 88:1083–1088, 2013. VC 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Disease Overview
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) was originally identified in

the Kiel classification as a “centrocytic lymphoma” [1]. This
type of lymphoma was termed a lymphocytic lymphoma of
intermediate differentiation by Berard and Dorfman [2]. A
distinct subtype of MCL was characterized by atypical small
lymphoid cells with wide mantles around benign germinal
centers and was called a mantle zone lymphoma [3]. With
the advent of the revised European-American and the later
World Health Organization classifications, MCL was made
a distinct lymphoma subtype and was termed an aggres-
sive lymphoma [4,5]. MCL represents about 4% of all
lymphomas in the US and 7–9% in Europe [6].

Patients with MCL have a median age in their 60s and
have a striking male predominance (2:1). Patients generally
have stage III/IV disease and present with extensive lymph-
adenopathy, blood and bone marrow involvement, and
splenomegaly [7]. Eighty percent of the patients with the
mantle zone variant have splenomegaly which may be
massive. The MCL patients can present with pancytopenia
or a leukemic presentation with extensive leukocytosis [8].
Some degree of peripheral blood involvement can be
detected in most cases by flow cytometry [9]. Other extra-
nodal sites include the gastrointestinal tract either in the
stomach or colon, liver, or in Waldeyer’s ring [10]. Some
patients have sheets of lymphomatous polyps of the large
bowel, lymphomatous polyposis, which sometimes leads to
the diagnosis of MCL [11]. If random blind biopsies are
done of normal appearing mucosa of the colon in patients

who have been diagnosed with MCL in other locations, a
large percentage are positive for MCL involvement [11].
Other extranodal sites for MCL involvement include the
skin, lacrimal glands, and central nervous system [10].

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is made on a biopsy of a lymph node, tis-

sue, bone marrow, or blood phenotype, which shows the
typical morphology of monomorphic small to medium sized
lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours [5]. Four
cytologic variants of MCL are recognized, including the
small cell variant, mantle zone variant, diffuse variant, and
the blastic variant [12]. Immunophenotyping is commonly
used with the MCL cells being CD201, CD51, and positive
for Cyclin D1, whereas being negative for CD10 and Bcl6
[5]. The hallmark chromosomal translocation t(11:14)
(q13;32) identifies MCL and can be shown in most cases

[13]. This translocation leads to the aberrant expression of
cyclin D1, which is not typically expressed in normal lym-
phocytes. A few cyclin D1 negative cases have been identi-
fied and appear to have an overexpression of cyclin D2 or
D3 instead [14]. Recently, overexpression of the transcrip-
tion factor, SOX11, has been described as a diagnostic
marker for MCL with the absence of SOX11 a characteristic
of indolent MCL [15]. Biologic features such as a high Ki-
67 proliferation index or p53 mutations and p16 deletions
are closely related to the more aggressive MCL subtypes
such as the blastoid variants [16]. A model of molecular
pathogenesis and progression of MCL has been proposed
by Jares et al. (Fig. 1) [17].

Staging procedures should include a complete blood
count, chemistry profile, a lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), a
bone marrow evaluation, with immunophenotyping by flow
cytometry of the bone marrow and blood, and computed
tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. There are
limited studies in using FDG-PET scanning for MCL, but it
is often clinically useful. The standard uptake values of
sites involved with MCL often have low or intermediate val-
ues [18]. Evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract with endos-
copy is warranted if there are clinical symptoms or if a
dose intense regimen will be used. Evaluation of the cere-
bral spinal fluid is not usually done unless there are neuro-
logic symptoms or if the patient has the blastoid variant
[19]. The majority of patients have stage III or IV disease
after complete staging is completed.

Risk Stratification
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was first devel-

oped for patients with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma [20]. This was used for patients with MLC but was
not very discriminatory, particularly for the lower risk
patients. More recently, the first prognostic index for MCL,
the Mantle cell International Prognostic Index (MIPI), was
formulated by the European MCL Network [21]. The inde-
pendent prognostic factors for shorter overall survival from
the MIPI were higher age, worse ECOG performance

status, higher LDH, and a higher white blood cell count at
diagnosis. These were calculated as a continuous parame-
ter and three groups emerged: MIPI low-risk with the
median overall survival not reached (5-yr OS 60%), MIPI
intermediate risk with a median OS of 51 months, and a
MIPI high risk group with a median OS of 29 months (Fig.
2)[21]. This index has now been validated by other groups
[22] (Table I).

A simplified modification of the MIPI has also been
developed, which has high concordance to the original
MIPI, but slightly less discriminatory power [21]. The addi-
tion of the Ki-67 proliferation index also provides some
additional discriminatory power [21] (Table II).

For each prognostic factor, 0 to 3 points are given and
the points are summed up to a maximum of 11. Patients
with 0–3 points are low risk, patients with 4–5 points are
intermediate risk, and patients with 6–11 points are high
risk. These risk categories correspond to the categories of
the original MIPI [21].

Gene expression profiling has been performed on a large
series of MCL patients to evaluate a molecular predictor
consisting of 20 proliferation associated genes [23]. How-
ever, a microarray-based technique is not feasible on a
wide scale. Therefore, further testing of a minimum number
of genes by formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue speci-
mens has been studied [24]. This study identified five
genes including RAN, MYC, TNFRSF10B, POLE2, and
SLC29A2 which were validated by a quantitative reverse-
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based
test and predicted survival in 73 patients with MCL. Further
validation of these genes and technique is needed before
this is used outside a research context.

Risk-Adapted Therapy
MCL is responsive to a variety of initial therapies, but rel-

atively short-term remissions are achieved with conven-
tional chemotherapy regimens. The median duration of
remission in most trials is 1.5–3 years, and the median OS
is 3–6 years with standard chemotherapy. However, there
is a wide variation in outcomes with some patients having a
very aggressive presentation and succumbing to their dis-
ease in a short period of time, while other patients at the
opposite end of the spectrum have a very indolent clinical
course. Because of the rarity of MCL, most trials have not
been large randomized trials, and much of the available
information is based on smaller phase II trials with histori-
cal controls.

Initial management of asymptomatic low MIPI or
elderly MCL patients

Given the unfavorable prognosis and the fact that stand-
ard therapy does not appear to cure patients with MCL, a
“watch and wait” strategy for patients with asymptomatic,
low MIPI or elderly MCL patients should be considered.
This strategy would be similar to that used for asymptom-
atic patients with follicular or other indolent lymphomas. In
a study from Weill-Cornell Medical Center, 97 patients with
MCL were evaluated [25]. Of the 97, 31 (32%) were
observed at the time of initial evaluation. These MCL
patients were 46% low-MIPI index when compared to 32%
low-MIPI in the patients who received initial treatment. The
median time to treatment for the observation group was 12
months (range 4 to 128 months) [25]. When this observa-
tional patient group needed treatment, the majority received
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone
(CHOP)—like treatment (55%), with some patients receiv-
ing rituximab monotherapy (13%), and at the time of publi-
cation five patients had never received any therapy [25].

When the asymptomatic elderly MCL patient population
does become symptomatic and requires therapy, a number

of options are available for treatment. Probably, the most
commonly used regimen in the past has been an
anthracycline-based therapy such as CHOP [26]. Rituximab
monotherapy has some modest activity in MCL [27]. More
recently, rituximab has been added to the drugs in CHOP
(R-CHOP) and tested in MCL. The first report of R-CHOP
for the treatment of MCL was in 40 previously untreated
patients and yielded an overall response rate (ORR) of
96%, including a complete response (CR) of 48% [28].
Despite 36% of the patients having a molecular CR, there
was no difference in the median progression-free survival
(PFS) between the patients who achieved a molecular CR
(16.5 months) and those who did not (18.8 months) [28].
There were similar results from a randomized study in the
German lymphoma study group which compared front-line
CHOP to R-CHOP. In this study, the addition of rituximab
to CHOP improved the ORR (94% vs. 75%, P50.0054)
and the CR rate (34% vs. 7%, P50.00024) [29]. However,
this did not translate into significant improvements in PFS
or OS in this study [29].

Purine analogues have also been used for the treatment
of MCL in the older patient population. Single agent fludar-
abine demonstrated an ORR< 40%; however, when com-
bined with cyclophosphamide and rituximab the response
rate is closer to 60% [30,31]. More recently, a large
randomized trial done in Germany demonstrated that
R-CHOP was superior to R-FC in the older MCL patient
population with a 4 year OS of 65% for R-CHOP and 50%
for R-FC (P5 0.0032) [32]. In addition, a second random-
ization was done for maintenance either with rituximab or
interferon. The arm that produced the best PFS and OS,
was R-CHOP followed by rituximab maintenance with a
4-year OS of 87% [32]. This is the first large randomized
trial which demonstrated a benefit for rituximab mainte-
nance in PFS for patients with MCL.

Another agent that has been tested in patients with MCL,
which demonstrated good activity is Bendamustine. A
randomized trial done in Europe compared R-CHOP to
R-Bendamustine in a number of different lymphomas [33].
In this trial, the patients with MCL had a similar ORR (89%
for BR and 95% for R-CHOP). The BR regimen was asso-
ciated with a lower progression rate 42% vs. 63% for the
R-CHOP arm [33]. In addition, the hematologic toxicity and
alopecia were less in the R-Bendamustine arm [33]. A sec-
ond study evaluating R-CHOP vs. R-Bendamustine did not
demonstrate a superior outcome for the R-Bendamustine
but did demonstrate an equivalent outcome [34]
Some clinical studies are testing agents used in relapsed
MCL in combinations in the front-line setting such as
R-CHOP1Bortezomib [35].
Recommendations: Asymptomatic elderly or low-
MIPI patients can be observed without any therapy.
When the patients become symptomatic, first line therapy
choices include R-CHOP (6 rituximab maintenance), R-
Bendamustine, or a clinical trial.

Initial management of a young symptomatic patient
Several studies have suggested that aggressive thera-

pies in younger patients with MCL may improve the out-
comes. One of the first studies to evaluate this was the
European MCL Network study where responding patients
under age 65 years were randomized after induction ther-
apy to receive either myeloablative radio-chemotherapy fol-
lowed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or
maintenance interferon [36]. In this study, the patients in
the ASCT arm had an improved PFS over those in the
interferon arm [36]. Several other single arm and retrospec-
tive studies have suggested patients receiving an induction
regimen that contains high-dose cytarabine, such as

hyperfractioned cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin,
and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose cytarabine
and methotrexate (HyperCVAD 6rituximab) experience
improved survival [37–39].

The addition to rituximab to 6–8 cycles of HyperCVAD
alternating with high dose cytarabine and methotrexate
yielded a CR rate of 87% and had a 7-year failure-free sur-
vival rate of 52% and OS of 68% [37]. This regimen was
tested in a multicenter trial and was found to have a similar
ORR of 88% and CR rate of 58%; however, there was
grade IV hematologic toxicity in 87% of the patients making
this regimen difficult to give in some community settings
[38]. It was also suggested in a retrospective study that
patients receiving R-HyperCVAD as an induction with auto
ASCT in CR1 had an improved outcome as compared to
R-CHOP [39]. However, a further analysis of a separate
cohort of MCL patients demonstrated that when corrected
for the MIPI, the outcomes may be similar [40].

Because the R-HyperCVAD alternating with methotrex-
ate/cytarabine is difficult to administer, modifications which
drop the methotrexate portion [41] or drop both the metho-
trexate and cytarabine have been tested [42]. In the study
from Geisler et al. [41], 160 younger MCL patients received
rituximab1maxi-CHOP, alternating with rituximab1 cytara-
bine. Responders received high-dose chemotherapy with
ASCT. The 6-year PFS was 66% and the OS was 70%.
Compared to a historical control without the cytarabine, the
results were much improved with the regimen as outlined
[41]. In a small pilot trial in an older population, the rituxi-
mab–Hyper CVAD regimen without the methotrexate or
cytarabine, but with maintenance rituximab demonstrated
an ORR of 77% and a median PFS of 37 months [42].
Another approach has been for patients to receive R-
CHOP X 3 cycles, then Rituximab, cisplatin, cytarabine,
dexamethasone (R-DHAP) X 3, followed by high dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation
[43]. This study also demonstrated an excellent 5-year
overall survival of 75% [43].

The role of autologous stem cell transplantation in CR1
has not been tested in a randomized trial. However in a ret-
rospective analysis of 167 MCL patients under age 65, the
patients received either R-HyperCVAD or R-CHOP followed
by an auto ASCT in CR1 had an improved PFS compared
to R-CHOP alone (P< 0.004), even when corrected for
prognostic factors. [44]. The best induction regimen before
transplant has not been defined but is currently being eval-
uated in clinical trials.
Recommendations: For young symptomatic patients with
MCL, considerations include R-HyperCVAD with high-dose
cytarabine (6Methotrexate) followed by ASCT in CR1 for
selected patients. For patients who are not candidates for
standard R-HyperCVAD with high dose cytarabine/metho-
trexate, possible alternatives include R-CHOP or
R-Bendamustine. If possible, ASCT in CR1 should still be
considered for these patients as well.

Management of relapse/refractory MCL
For patients with relapsed but asymptomatic MCL, fur-

ther “watch and wait” maybe possible as there are a per-
centage of patients with indolent MCL who may not need
therapy for months or years. Once the patient becomes
symptomatic many options are considerations. The Benda-
mustine1 rituximab (BR) regimen has also been tested in
relapsed MCL patients. A phase II study of BR in 63
patients with relapsed/refractory MCL demonstrated an
ORR or 90% with a CR of 60% and a median PFS of 30
months [45].

Because many standard lymphoma salvage regimens
have limited activity in MCL, novel treatment approaches

based on targeting known signaling pathways have been
tested. The first such agent to be tested as a proteasome
inhibitor, bortezomib. As a monotherapy, bortezomib has
demonstrated ORRs in the 30–40% range [46]. In a large
phase II study of 141 evaluable MCL patients treated with
bortezomib, there was an ORR of 33% with a CR rate of
8% [47]. With further follow up, the phase II study of borte-
zomib demonstrated a median time to progression of 6.7
months and a median OS of 23.5 months [48]. Bortezomib
has also been combined with other agents such as Benda-
mustine and rituximab in the BVR regimen which also had
excellent activity. In patients with MCL, the ORR rate for
the BVR regimen was 71% [49].

The PI3Kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway is implicated in the
pathogenesis of MCL [50]. Based upon this information the
mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus was tested in a phase II study
of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL. In this study, tem-
sirolimus demonstrated moderate activity with an ORR of
44% [51]. In a phase III study of 162 relapsed/refractory
patients with MCL, high doses of temsirolimus (175 mg/75
mg) resulted in an ORR of 22% and a PFS of 4.8 months
[52]. Other mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus, have also
demonstrated activity in MCL [53].

The immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide has also
shown promising activity against MCL. In a phase II study,
Zinzani et al. [54] reported an ORR of 41% in 39 MCL
patients treated with lenalidomide. The larger EMERGE
trial tested single agent lenalidomide in 134 patients with
relapsed MCL. The ORR was 28% with a 7.5% CR rate
[55]. There studies led to the FDA approval of lenalidomide
for patients with relapsed MCL who had failed bortezomib.
Lenalidomide has also been combined with rituximab with
promising results. In a study by Wang et al. [56], 52
patients with recurrent MCL were treated with lenalidamide
and rituximab for recurrent disease. In this study, the ORR
was 58% and the CR rate was 33% with the combination
being well tolerated.

Other agents that appear to have activity in MCL include
the brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor (PCI-32765,
Ibruitinib) and PI3Kinase inhibitor (GS-1101, Idelalisib)
which target the B-cell receptor pathways. In a study of 51
MCL patients, the BTK inhibitor was reported to have a
69% ORR and a CR rate of 16%, with no differences
between bortezomib na€ıve and patients who had relapsed
after receiving bortezomib [57]. Kahl et al. reported on 38
patients with MCL who were treated with Idelalisib who
demonstrated a 48% ORR [58].

There is not much data available for standard involved
field irradiation in MCL. However, there is data with the use
of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with Yttrium 90—Ibritumomab
Tiuxetan in patients with relapsed MCL demonstrating an
ORR of 31% [59]. When RIT is used to consolidate after
immunochemotherapy, it resulted in improvement of the
percentages of responses compared with historical controls
[60].

The use of high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT for
patients with relapsed MCL has not demonstrated as prom-
ising results as with front-line use. However, a resent analy-
sis of the CIBMTR data demonstrated in 159 MCL patients
receiving an autologous transplant for relapsed disease,
the 5-year OS was 44% and for 99 patients receiving an
allogeneic transplant for MCL, the 5-year OS was 32%
[61]. In appropriate patients with relapsed MCL who had a
long initial remission and have been successfully salvaged,
ASCT in CR2 maybe a consideration. Allogeneic stem cell
transplantation is felt to be the only potentially curative
treatment for advanced MCL. A number of small studies
using various reduced intensity preparative regimens with
an allogeneic source of stem cell have been reported

annual clinical updates in hematological malignancies: a continuing medical education series

1086 American Journal of Hematology



[62,63]. In a study by Tam et al. [62], 35 patients with
relapsed MCL receiving a reduced intensity regimen with
an allogeneic stem cell transplant. With a median follow up
of 56 months, the 6-year PFS was 46% and the 6-year
actuarial OS was 53% [62]. Although the relapse rates are
less with allogeneic transplantation, the risks of graft-
versus host disease and infectious complications are much
higher resulting in similar short term but apparently
improved long term results compared to autologous stem
cell transplantation for relapsed MCL.
Recommendations: My first choice for a relapsed MCL
patient would be bendamustine/rituximab if the patient has
not previously received bendamustine. Other options would
include a bortezomib containing regimen or lenalidamide. If
the patient is a candidate for stem cell transplantation, con-
sideration for an autologous transplant if there was a long
first remission or a reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell
transplant should be given. When clinically available, B-cell
receptor pathway inhibitors would be an excellent choice
for therapy as well.
